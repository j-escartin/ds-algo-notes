# Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms

## Yow! Let  the Journey begin 💪

This repo is  my personal **playground** for taking **Data Structures and Algorithms** to whole new  level.

### 💡 Why am I doing this?
Because **DSA is the  backbone** of great software engineering.
- Want to **write efficient code**?  Learn DSA.
- Want to **ace coding interviews**? Learn DSA.
- Want to **become a top-notch engineer**? Well... you  get the point.

Without truly **understanding** why a certain **data structure or algorithm** is the best fit, how can you call
yourself an engineer? 🤔

## 📚 **What’s in this repo?**  
I'm following the **University of California, San Diego**'s structured program on edX:  
🔗 [Algorithms and Data Structures by UC San Diego](https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures)  

This repository contains:  
✅ **Course Notes** – Summaries, explanations, and insights 📝  
✅ **Solutions to Problems** – My implementations, tests, and optimizations 💻  
✅ **Visualizations & Diagrams** – Because pictures are worth a thousand lines of code 📊  
✅ **Project-Based Learning** – Real-world applications of DSA 🚀
